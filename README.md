As per the problem statement, I had to pass the first name and last name through the parametrized constructor "Employee" but i wrote the program in which it is asking for the first name
and last name from the user and then generating credentials accordingly.
Through this program, user can input any first name and last name and the program will generate it's credentials as per the input entered.

Still I have created Employee class and parametrized constructor which can pass first name and last name as Harshit Choudhary as mentioned in the problem statement but passed it as comment.
